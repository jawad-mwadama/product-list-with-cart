# Configuration Files (often handled by other tools like ESLint or kept manually)
# You generally want to ignore the config files unless you explicitly want Prettier formatting them.
# For example, we want Prettier to ignore the Tailwind config which causes issues:
# prettier.config.cjs 
# tailwind.config.js 
# .prettierrc

# Other Tooling

# Logs
*.log

# Windows specific
thumbs.db

# Any files that should remain exactly as is (e.g., vendor libraries)
vendor/
